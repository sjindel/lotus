Style rules:

The style rules are defined by my preferences, as expressed through the GitHub
code review system.

Every file must have a header at the top indicated that it is licensed under the
LICENSE file.

The LICENSE file is also where we will put copyright information for the
contributors.

C++ code should generally follow the LLVM style guide.
